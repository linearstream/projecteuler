# Multiples of 3 and 5

## C Solution

The [C solution](c/) tries to minimize time and space complexity by keeping a rolling sum only and going through both the 3 multiples and 5 multiples as it progresses.
The sum type was chosen with foreknowledge of the answer and would overflow if the problem space was changed to try that.
